We've been talking about how we can use networks and social networks,
in particular, to understand how people receive novel information,
things like job leads.
And we had gotten to the point of having this insight that there's
this idea of a local bridge in the network.
Someone you're connected to where you have no other friends in common.
And such a person probably belongs to different social groups and travels
in other circles that you don't.
And therefore, they're probably often a source of novel information
that you don't have access to.
What we'd like to do is relate this idea of you
being connected by someone to someone by a local bridge
to this distinction between close friends and acquaintances,
which is what, for example, sociologists, like Mark Vandevetter,
discovered was an important distinction when they interviewed people
about how they found jobs.
OK.
So we'd like to go back to a graph we've been looking at.
It has a local bridge in it.
There it is, between A and B. And we'd like to annotate the edges,
we'd like to divide them into two types-- close friends
and acquaintances.
Or in the language of social networks research
in this area, strong ties and weak ties.
Strong ties connecting you strongly to close friends, weak ties
to more distant acquaintances.
And I've labeled it sort of arbitrarily, but maybe a bit
intuitively that it sort of feels like if B is over in this other social group
travels those circles, maybe B is a weak tie.
And that's exactly the thing that we'd like to pursue.
Right?
To what extent can we actually say that there's
some reason why we should expect these things, these connections, that
bring us new information to be weak ties often?
OK.
So in order to justify why weak ties play an important role here,
why distant acquaintances somehow have something to do with local bridges,
I want to first extend the idea of triadic closure, which was just
about an edge forming when the two ends had a friend in common.
I'd like to extend that to also incorporate
the notion of strong ties and weak ties.
And the idea here is going to be to say that we should expect
that if we know which has the strong ties which has the weak ties,
that triadic closure should operate particularly powerfully if I have
two close friends who don't know each other.
Right?
If I have two close friends who don't know each other,
that seems like a sort of particular time
when they might end up becoming friends, for sort of all the reasons we talked.
Right?
All the bases for triadic closure should operate more powerfully
if these are two close friends of mine.
I have more incentive to bring them together.
They have more opportunities to meet each other.
And so we'll think about triadic closure in the presence
of trying weak ties as something we want to focus particularly on.
What are the implications when I have these two strong ties?
So I'll say that, in particular, nodes should
obey this thing called the strong triadic closure property.
And what I'm going to do is actually define it
in this very sort of clean mathematical way which is clearly
going to be an oversimplification of reality.
What we'd like to do is through that oversimplification
try to derive some consequences actually at a mathematical level, just
reasoning about graphs.
OK?
So it's actually in a way easier to say what
it would mean for a node to violate the strong triadic closure property
than to satisfy it, so let me talk about what I mean to violate.
I'll say that a node a violates the strong triadic closure
property if it has strong ties to two nodes, B and C,
but there is no edge between B and C. That
would be a violation of strong triadic closure
because that triangle failed to close.
So for example, if I had drawn this example
graph in a slightly different way.
And I were to put in, for example, strong ties from A to F
and a strong tie from A to E. OK.
So here we have A to F, A to E, those are both strong ties.
That would indicate a violation.
A is violating the strong triadic closure property
because A has two friends linked by strong ties, E and F,
and there's not even a weak tie between them.
There's no edge between them.
That's strong triadic closure.
And we'll simply say A node satisfies a strong triadic closure
property if it doesn't violate.
Now it's obvious that strong triadic closure is too powerful a notion
to actually hold in reality.
It's requiring that every time you have two close friends,
they should at least distantly know each other.
And you can probably think of examples from your own life
where that's not quite true.
But again, we're trying to intentionally simplify
things for the sake of making a clean mathematical definition.
Right?
So in the same way that maybe in a intro physics class
we might try to assume away the effect of air friction
when we go to analyze the flight of a baseball through the air.
Here, we're sort of assuming away a bunch of messiness and saying,
suppose we have the absolute starkest thing here,
we have strong triadic closure.
Using strong triadic closure, we can actually
now make the link between the structural property, local bridges,
and the interpersonal property of weak ties.
And we can actually do it by reasoning mathematically about the graph.
So unlike, for example, when we were talking about the global friendship
network and we were sort of speculating, here we're not going to speculate.
Here we're going to actually start with some very concrete definitions--
a graph, it's edges are divided into strong and weak ties.
And say all nodes satisfy the strong triadic closure
property, which, again, is a mathematical definition.
We then would like to mathematically derive
a relationship between local bridges and weak ties.
And here is that relationship.
And we'll phrase it in the form of a claim.
Suppose node A satisfies the strong triadic closure property.
Other nodes may or may not, but A does.
And suppose that it's involved in at least two strong ties.
So that's kind of a very mild assumption.
It just says A has at least two close friends in the world.
Then here's the conclusion.
Any local bridge it is involved in must be a weak tie.
So here, for example, we've drawn this network again.
Now we've labeled the A to F edge actually so that it's a weak tie.
So A, in fact, in this picture satisfies strong triadic closure.
We can check that because it's three strong ties with the C, D, and E ,
and they are all connected.
So A satisfies strong triadic closure.
It's involved in at least two strong ties.
And it is involved in a local bridge to B, that is indeed a weak tie.
We'd like to argue that must be true in general.
If A satisfies strong triadic closure, at least two strong ties,
any of its local bridges must be a weak tie.
And here's how we're actually going to try proving that mathematically.
We're going to argue by contradiction.
We're going to say, all right, suppose by way of contradiction
that A has a strong tie to B, and this A-B edge is a local bridge.
What we'll try to do is get to a contradiction, a contradiction
to our assumption that A satisfies strong triadic closure.
And through that contradiction, we'll show
that this assumption couldn't hold.
And in fact, therefore, that this A-B local bridge must be a weak tie.
OK.
Well so we don't have a lot to go on when
we reason by contradiction because we're only assuming very few things.
But one thing we're assuming is that A has at least two strong ties.
Well we see one strong tie to B. But there
must be at least one other lurking out there somewhere.
Let's say it's sum node C. So we've drawn here
there's a strong tie to node C. OK.
The next step, we also know that the A-B edge is a local bridge.
So we know that there is no edge between B and C. Why is there no edge?
Because if there were an edge between B and C,
then A and B would have C as a common friend
and it wouldn't be a local bridge.
OK.
So there's no B-C edge, but there are strong ties.
A has strong ties to both B and C with no edge.
That violates the strong triadic closure property.
And so, in fact, it does contradict our assumption
that A satisfied the strong triadic closure problem.
And that's the end of the proof.
It shows that under our assumptions any local bridge that A is involved in
must be a weak tie.
So this claim actually establishes at a formal mathematical level the link
that we wanted at a more intuitive level.
Right?
The local interpersonal property of weak ties
that this person's an acquaintance, and the structural property
of local bridges, that this edge reaches into another social group.
It's a source of novel information.
Now, again, I have to stress.
We phrased this thing very, very starkly to be
able to prove a mathematical statement because we
said with a strong triadic closure it's a very strong property.
But we can also try to learn from it.
What is it telling us at a more qualitative level?
Roughly, the point behind the proof is saying
that local bridges tend to be weak ties because if they were strong ties,
then Triadic Closure would operate around them
to shortcut that local bridge to give the two ends mutual friends
and it would thereby no longer become a local bridge.
So those local bridges actually persist over time.
They're likely to be weak ties.
That's why they remain local bridges.
And in turn, they connect us to these people
who travel in other circles, who have novel information, who
can give us things like new job leads.
And so this way in which these weak ties link us
to these other parts of the network that,
in the end through this kind of structure,
turns out to be the surprising strength of weak ties and social networks.
