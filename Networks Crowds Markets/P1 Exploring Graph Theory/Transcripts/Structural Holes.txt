In our discussions about social networks,
a useful conceptual picture has been emerging of social networks
as consisting of tightly-knit communities
with the bridging links that go between them.
So in particular, an edge between two people in a social network
can either be deeply embedded in one community-- these two people belong
to the same community, they have a lot of common friends--
or it can have more of a bridging structure.
It connects two people who fundamentally are rooted in different communities.
And you can think in your own life, how some of your connections
stay within communities that you travel in a lot,
that you're very comfortable with.
And other of your connections to people actually
go outside and span a lot of social distance.
One other insight that begin to emerge as people thought about this--
and was really a style of analysis pioneered
by the sociologist Ron Burch-- was that in this configuration,
some people have access to many types of bridging links
and other people have access to many fewer.
In other words, people often stake out different
positions in the territory of the social network,
so that some people stand essentially at the boundary of a community
and they link to many other communities.
And other people often can sit at the center of a community.
And so many of their connections are all within that one community
And so following Ron Burch's expositional lead
in talking about this, let's think about a story involving managers
within organizations, say within a company, and the different experiences
that two people in this very same organization,
at the very same job description, could have
based on their position in the social network.
And so the story I want to talk about involves a social network-- really,
sort of a schematic cartoon picture of a social network.
And I've drawn it here.
And you'll B, immediately, you see that this organization-- or at least,
the set of managers in this organization--
forms three conceptual clusters.
There is the one containing A, B, E, and F, and these two other unlabeled nodes.
There's the cluster the contains C, and the cluster that contains D.
And we see that nodes A and B have staked out
these two different types of positions that I was just talking about.
A is at the center of a cluster, and all of A's friends come from that cluster--
all the people that A talks to within the organization.
B, who has the same number of connections as A-- they both have
five-- but B is sort of at the border of this cluster
and reaches out into other ones.
And so three of the people B talks to regularly, A, E, and F,
are in what's sort of B's home community.
And then C and D reach out to other communities.
And the point of this style of analysis is that A and B actually
have very different sources of relative advantages when
they think about how they can operate within this organization.
So from A's point of view, the advantage of being deeply embedded
in this cluster-- to have these edges that
have many mutual friends surrounding them--
is that you can often get greater trust in your interactions.
So when A interacts with E, or when A interacts with F or with B, what we see
is that all of these interactions are effectively
chaperoned by many mutual friends that they both have.
And so, in the event of misbehavior by either of them,
there are many people who can kind of observe and disapprove.
And that effectively creates an incentive
for these kind of interactions to go smoothly,
to go well, because they're embedded in this social community
with lots of people effectively watching through the mutual friendships.
B, on the other hand, has riskier interactions.
His interactions with A, E, and F are embedded in that cluster.
But the interactions with C and D have a very different nature,
because there effectively is no third party who
can witness that BC interaction or that BD interaction.
And as a result, its riskier.
In the event of misbehavior, there's no comparable opportunity
for subsequent social sanctions by anyone.
And so, there's less incentive for everybody to behave well.
There's less trust placed in those kind of interactions.
On the other hand, B has this different form of counterbalancing advantage.
And in Ron Burch's language, what B is doing
is spanning a set of structural holes in the organization.
We can think of a structural hole as this kind of deliberately informal term
for the empty space in the social network
where links have failed to form.
So between C's cluster and D's cluster, for whatever reason,
links have not formed.
And so B is kind of the unique broker between those two clusters.
And that position of brokerage for B actually gives B a lot of benefits.
For one thing, it can be an amplifier for creativity.
The argument is that B is the only person who's
exposed to the ideas that originate in C's cluster and in D's cluster.
And so if someone is going to have an insight, a new way
to combine those ideas, it's going to B. And similarly, it also
gives B a source of power.
B is a effectively a gatekeeper, regulating the flow of information
that comes from C's cluster and D's cluster
into B's own home cluster that contains A, E, and F. Than can make
B a particularly valued member of the organization in ways
that the other people can't be.
What we see is that there's these counterbalancing
contrasts-- A versus B. A has embedded interactions.
It has a lot of trust in these interactions.
B has these riskier interactions that can be greater access to information,
ways of combining information in novel ways.
And empirical studies of organizations in a number of cases
has found that people who play the role of B, who span structural holes,
can often have a number of concrete benefits in the organization--
that their ideas can be taken up more quickly, that they can be promoted
and advanced through the organization more quickly.
And so by thinking about the social network and the way in which links
are divided across clusters and within clusters,
we can begin to think about some of the higher-level outcomes that
arise through the social processes that take place
in these structures-- in organizations, in companies, in schools,
and among groups of friends.
