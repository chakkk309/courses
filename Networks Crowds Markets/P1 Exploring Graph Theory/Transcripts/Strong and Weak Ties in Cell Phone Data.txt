We've been talking about the strength of weak ties, the often surprising way
in which connections to people that you're not very close to
can actually provide you with information,
with access to parts of the network that you otherwise just
wouldn't be able to come into contact with.
Now this was a theory that was worked out,
as we've been discussing, originally in the 1960s and 1970s.
And it was really based often on studies performed at relatively small scales
and with the data analysis performed at relatively small scales.
As massive social network data sets began
to emerge in the first decade of the 21st century, 2000 to 2010,
it began to become possible to actually look
at the strength of weak ties theory and a number of other theories
through the lens of these massive online sets of data.
And so I want to talk about how people do this for the strength of weak ties,
and in particular, a study done in 2007 by JP Onnela and his colleagues.
Which, in a way, illustrates a line of work that's become extremely active.
And that is taking the digital traces that we
get from online social networking sites, instant messaging, cell phone
calls, and to build social networks out of them,
build social networks on millions or even hundreds of millions of people,
and then to try to study these theories that
have been developed at much smaller scales.
And in this way, there's been this interesting interplay
between two very different styles of research
around these social phenomenon-- one that works at small scales
and develops these theories under these complex,
nuanced settings with limited amounts of data;
and the other that takes these massive data sets from these digital traces
and tries to study phenomena at that scale.
And really, each of these is providing value of a different sort.
And I think, in the end, one big goal of this whole research enterprise
is try to find the place where these two styles of research come together
and where they can actually work together and produce new insights.
So let's see how this worked with the strength of weak ties.
So what JP Onnela and his colleagues did was
to get a cell phone data set from, as they described it,
a moderately sized European country.
And so effectively think of several million people,
all cellphone subscribers.
And what we have is for each pair of them
who talked on the phone, how many minutes per month they talked.
So we can, in a natural way, build a network here.
And I've drawn sort of a schematic of maybe a small piece of it
with only nine of these cell phone users.
And so we draw an edge between each pair of cell phone users
who talked during the month.
Now we like to think about the strength of weak ties.
But we can't really just go in and annotate each edge as strong and weak.
And that's really the first point that emerges here.
Often if we have a big messy data set, we
have to take the clean definitions that we used when we developed our theory,
and try to adapt it without distorting it too much
to conform to the kind of data that we're able to look it.
So in particular, strong and weak was always
just sort of a binary distinction when there really
is all sorts of intermediate scales in between.
And what we're going to do is take the number of minutes people talked
on the phone and use that effectively as a proxy for the strength of the tie.
Lots of minutes spent talking on the phone,
we're going to say indicates a stronger tie.
Now, it's not a perfect proxy.
After all, you can feel close to people that you unfortunately
don't get to talk to very much.
But it's going to be what we're able to get out of the data.
More minutes on the phone, stronger tie.
And so we can imagine annotating the edge with the number of minutes
that they spent talking on the phone.
Now the other thing that we have to do is
we have to look at this notion of local bridges.
Because effectively, the part of the strength
of weak ties theory that we would like to investigate
is this idea that people with stronger ties
are less likely to be part of local bridges,
and see how that works out in the data.
The problem is in this data there actually were unfortunately
relatively few local bridges.
Because in the end, often many people had a third party that they talked to.
So what we'd like to do is actually relax the definition of local bridge
and talk about certain edges being more local bridgy than others.
So how would that work in this picture?
Well, for example, this AB edge, it's not a local bridge
because to be a local bridge, you have to have no friends in common
and they have F in common.
But they do only have one friend in common.
And so that's sort of close to being a local bridge.
In particular, it's closer to being a local bridge
than say this AE edge because A and E have two friends in common, C and D.
So what we could say is that the embeddedness of the edge
is the number of mutual friends that the endpoints of the edge have in common.
AB has embeddedness of one.
AE has embeddedness of two.
Now, low embeddedness means you're closer to being a local bridge,
but it's even more significant if you have
a low embeddedness among a very, very large number of neighbors.
And so we're going to find a second concept, the neighborhood overlap,
which is actually going to be a ratio.
It's a sort of relative embeddedness.
So its numerator is the number of nodes who are neighbors of both ends,
so neighborhood overlap of the AB edge.
The numerator is the number of common neighbors, which is one in this case.
And the denominator is the number of nodes
who were neighbors of either of them, or at least one of them.
So in this case, there are actually seven nodes
that are neighbors of at least one of them.
There's C, D, and E, there's F, and there's G, H, and I.
So the AB edge has neighborhood overlap of 1 over 7,
whereas the AE edge has an embeddedness of 2,
and there are 4 nodes who are neighbors of at least one of them-- C,
D, B, and F. And so it has a neighborhood overlap of 2 over 4,
or 1/2.
So this was the idea.
We took strength of tie and we took local bridge.
And we have proxies for them now.
Number of minutes on the phone becomes a proxy for tie strength,
and neighborhood overlap becomes a proxy for the notion of being a local bridge.
It's a kind of softening of it.
And the thing we would like to test is whether as you
spend more minutes on the phone talking to someone,
do you have greater neighborhood overlap?
Are you further from being a local bridge?
And this would be the idea that sometimes there's
a correspondence between being a weak tie-- having few minutes--
and being close to being a local bridge-- having very low neighborhood
overlap.
So we're going to try to plot this.
So we're going to define a pair of axes.
And on the x-axis, we're going to put the number of minutes
you spend talking on the phone.
So that's a nice quantitative measure.
And we're going to take everyone who had a certain number of minutes talking
on the phone and we're going figure out what
was their average neighborhood overlap.
And we're going to plot that as the y-coordinate.
So the y-axis is the neighborhood overlap.
And if we believe in this theory quantitatively, then what we should see
is that there's going be a curve that goes up.
More minutes on the phone, greater neighborhood overlap.
And so now this is the moment where you have this massive data set,
you have a theory that you want to test, and you wonder,
is this really going to work or not?
And when this data first began coming in, of course, it wasn't clear.
No one had ever really seen these plots before,
which was sort of a very striking thing.
But when these plots began getting produced, they began arriving,
and we were able to look at them.
In fact, you see this beautiful, clean, increasing relationship and really,
very, very smooth.
Almost as smooth and clear as if it had come out
of some kind of physical experiment.
But of course, it hadn't.
This was just people going about their everyday lives, talking on the phone,
and being embedded in the social structure
that they carry out their ordinary lives in.
But what we find is that when you average over all of that,
you actually see this very, very clean, clear relationship.
Greater tie strength, or at least greater amount of time spent together,
corresponds to greater neighborhood overlap.
And so this was one of the studies in the early phases
of looking at these massive data sets and trying
to understand social phenomena through that lens.
And as time has gone on, these days have become more rich, more complicated,
and have begun to connect even more closely
with the kind of sociological theories that we see at smaller scales as well.
And it's also become part of the design space.
So now over the past couple years, for example,
you see sites like Facebook, for example,
thinking in terms of strong and weak ties
when they figure out how to connect you to news from your friends,
and the different effects that news across these different kind of links
is going to have.
And so in this way, it's not simply that these phenomena are being borne out
in the data sets, but they're actually entering our design space
as we think about the way information flows
in both the online world and the offline world.
