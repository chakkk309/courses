We've now seen some of the basic definitions for graphs-- the idea
that there can be a path between two nodes,
the graph is connected if every pair of nodes has a path between it.
And when it's not connected, we've talked
about it falls apart into connected components, these pieces that
are internally connected with no edges between them.
And we used all this to analyze a graph that was small enough
that we could draw it completely by hand--
the young internet in the late 1970s when it only had 13 nodes.
Now we see how we'd use this to reason about a graph that's
much too big to draw, and how we can use some of these definitions
and still talk about the graph and actually
learn about it, even though we're not really
going to be able to draw pictures of it.
There are a bunch of graphs we could do this with.
And actually, as we go on, we'll see that we're
going to be able to do this with a lot of different graphs.
I want to start with one that is sort of intuitively compelling.
We all have our own kind of sense of it, our own intuitions about it,
and that's what I'll call the global friendship network.
This is simply a graph where there's a node for each person on earth
and there's an edge between every pair of people who are friends.
And we can define friends however we want here.
Let's say friend means you sort of know them on a first name basis.
They know you on a first name basis.
If you passed each other on the street, you
would likely get into a conversation, that kind of notion of friend.
OK.
So let's ask some questions about this graph.
First of all, I should stress that this is not
a graph that anyone has written down.
We think about big networks like Facebook
which has over 1 billion people or the global phone network.
These are approximations to the global friendship network,
but they're not quite there maybe for two reasons.
One is that not everyone is on these systems, obviously.
And the other is that friendship doesn't quite equal talking on the phone.
It doesn't quite equal being connected by a friend link on Facebook.
So let's think about the real global friendship network,
just so we can do this thought experiment.
And when we think about it, I should stress,
we're going to speculate a little bit.
And here it'll be OK to speculate.
Let's just use our intuitions and think how these definitions would play out.
So as a starting question, is the global friendship network connected?
It's a reasonable question to ask.
So is it the case that every two people, there's some path through friendships.
Not only are they friends with each other,
but is there a path of friendships from one to the other?
And if you think about it, it feels like the answer is probably no.
For example, if there was simply a single person
on the earth who just had no friends.
Maybe they just don't like people.
Maybe for some reason, maybe they're old and their friends
have died or something.
But one way or another, a single person with no friends
would make the graph unconnected.
And that's a way to appreciate how brittle this notion of connectivity is.
A single node can negate it-- someone who no friends.
Or if you want a small secluded group, this canonical notion
of a remote village that somehow has no contact to the outside world,
that would be a very small component with more than one person,
but a separate component.
So if the graph is not connected, then what do its components look like?
What do we have?
So maybe there's some one node components,
these people with no friends.
And maybe there's some very small ones like these if they're remote villages
and they haven't been reached by the rest of the world.
But what about other components?
So how about the component you're in, for example.
So for that, let's think about you.
And although I said the whole graph was too big to draw--
and that's certainly true-- we can at least
start to draw a cartoon version of the picture around you.
So there's you.
And what is your part of the network look like?
What are your friends?
Well, let's just speculate some more.
So for example, maybe you have friends from childhood
and they know each other, of course.
So there's you and two friends from childhood,
and you form this whole triangle right here.
Maybe you have a job with coworkers.
You have a boss.
Those people know each other, so you and your coworkers, your boss,
you all know each other.
And that's sort of a different lobe of your friend neighborhood.
It's the same over there.
And maybe family members, maybe a sibling, a parent.
They're in there too.
And of course, they might have interesting relations
to other parts of your life.
So your sibling might, for example, play this interesting role
where they know some of your friends from childhood.
They know some of your coworkers.
They know your parent, presumably.
And so that person kind of has an interesting shape in the network.
So the component you're in certainly has all of that.
But that's still not very big.
Let's think about that in the entire network.
So let's say you and let's think about one of your coworkers.
Let's pick a coworker who was born in a different country, moved
moved recently, and is now working with you, lives close to you,
but grew up very far away in the world.
Think about that coworker's parents who still live back in the country
where they grew up.
These are people who don't speak the same language as you
or are quite far around the world.
But you do have this person in common, this friend that you both know.
But now think about your coworker's parents' friend.
So they have a friend.
This too is someone who grew up somewhere around the world,
has no language in common with you, and no longer even has people
in common with you.
So you could be traveling around the world somewhere.
You could end up sitting next to them on a train.
And you'd be sitting next to this person who
is maybe significantly older than you and looks different from you,
dresses different from you, has no language in common.
You'd really have absolutely no idea there
was anything you had in common with this person,
despite the fact that there's actually this path of length three between you.
And we can expand out in almost any direction like this.
And what we're starting to learn that the connecting component that
contains you is a really very big component.
It includes people from all over the world, all different cultures,
all different age ranges.
It seems to actually contain some very large fraction of the entire world.
And so one way to say this, again, being actually deliberately informal
is that you're part of what we call a giant component.
And in fact, lots of big, complex networks
have what's called a giant component, which
is a single connected component that contains
a large fraction of all of the nodes.
So that's a useful insight about complex networks.
And we got it again, by speculating, but we've
been speculating on pretty safe grounds.
It seems pretty clear that there really is this giant component.
And in fact, if you go into a big phone network or into the Facebook graph,
you in fact see this giant component.
Now here's a question.
Could there be two giant components in the graph?
Could the global friendship network have two giant components?
And the answer, if you think about it, seems almost surely to be no.
We think about big societies that separate themselves
from the world, governments that have closed
their borders to the rest of the world.
You think maybe that's a big component.
But people still do travel there and someone there
might know someone near where you live.
And the point really is that a component, it's internally connected,
but it has to have no edges out of it.
And the thing with two giant components would be a single edge between them
would bring them together and would turn them into a single component.
So again, this notion of component is also
sort of brittle in that two big components, one edge would negate that.
It would turn them into a single component.
Maybe like having these two giant clouds of stuff
next to each other and a single spark brings them together,
and the whole thing would burst into a single component.
And so it seems almost sure that there are not two giant components.
And that's in fact true.
If you were to check data and not speculate,
you would in fact find that you almost never have two giant components.
In fact, it's interesting to think about have there ever been situations
where you had two giant components in the world friendship network.
And in fact, you could argue that at some point in human history,
it's possible that that was true.
If we think about say, 10,000 years ago, there's
been an interesting set of books written to try
to interpret cultural history from this very long range geographic perspective.
One example of this is Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel,
which Cornell University actually had all
of the incoming freshman read in 2001.
And at the time, although we weren't really thinking about it that way,
we all read this book.
And you start to appreciate he was sort of making a statement about networks.
It was really asking us to think about the cataclysm that
befell the civilizations in the Americas roughly 500 to 1,000 years ago when
people from Europe began arriving in North and South America,
and these two cultures began meeting.
And one way to interpret what it was saying actually
was that the world, maybe 10,000 years ago, actually,
the friendship network had two giant components-- one
in the Europe Asia land mass and one in the Americas.
And what that meant was that when you had two distinct giant components,
culture of all separately, technology of all separately, and maybe even worse,
diseases of all separately.
And so what happened was when Europeans began meeting people in the Americas
for the first time, these two giant components being coming together.
And it really was also a gigantic amount of potential energy was released.
And in particular, the technology and maybe more importantly,
the germs of Europeans completely overwhelmed the civilizations
in the Americas with extremely destructive consequences.
And so the point here is that when we think
about a network like the global friendship network
and we start thinking about the basic graph
theoretical definitions we have at our disposal,
we can actually begin to understand stuff about structure that we may not
have initially a priori thought of.
And they have been hard to articulate without this kind of language.
And we can even begin to interpret events over the course of history
in this kind of language and maybe try to understand better
why some of these things have turned out the way that they did.
