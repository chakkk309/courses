One of the powerful things about networks as a conceptual framework
is that they can help us think about many different kinds
of social and economic processes.
And let's start out by talking about a particular one
that we see in many, many contexts, which is the way in which networks
regulate the flow of information that we receive.
A lot of what we find out about the world,
a lot of what we know about the world, it actually
comes to us through our friends.
Our friends link us to the rest of the network.
And through them, a lot of information gets filtered-- a lot of advice,
a lot of recommendations, a lot of things
that actually help us understand what's going on.
And different friends play different roles in this process.
And you can think about it in your own life
how you rely on certain people for certain kinds of advice or information
or help, and other people for other kinds of things.
And that's something that we'd like to explore more deeply
and to think about the different people who we're connected to
and the different roles that they play.
To set this up and to motivate it, let's actually
start with a concrete story that is really
going to turn out to illustrate this theme very nicely.
It's a story about a sociologist named Mark Granovetter who
early in his career was studying how people found jobs.
And jobs are one of the things we often learn about through friends,
and therefore, one of those things where the social network often
plays a very important role.
But when you talk to people, they often said
they have learned about the job they currently
had not through a close friend, but from an acquaintance.
He would say, so you learned about it through a friend.
They'd say no, an acquaintance.
Why is that?
Why were people so frequently saying it was acquaintances who had told them
about the lead that led to the job they ended up currently having?
It was sort of a puzzle.
And it's a puzzle that kind of works at an interesting level in the network
context because it relates something structural--
how information gets to us about jobs-- to something interpersonal-- how
close we feel to different friends, close friends versus acquaintances.
In the end, Mark Granovetter found this amazing link between the two,
between the structural and the interpersonal.
And he defined this notion of weak ties and showed
that they play this very important role in social networks.
And so what I'd like to do is talk about weak ties,
what they are, how they operate.
And maybe from that we can sort of interpret this interesting situation
with jobs and by extension, with really novel information in general.
So in order to do this, we needed a few ingredients.
And first, let's just think a bit more about where
links come from in social networks.
So some links, you meet these people very early on.
They're friends you've had for a long time.
You may not think about where those links came from.
But others get formed over time, often by virtue of people you already know.
So let's consider a very small picture of a network.
Let's say there's this node, A here.
And A knows some other people-- B, C, D, and E. Now, B and C
don't know each other, but they have A in common as a friend.
And so over time, we actually might expect that this link between B and C
is going to form.
So in some sense, B and C were separate and now they've been brought together.
The network changed.
And the social network is changing all the time as people meet each other,
or even, I guess, as people have falling outs and it just could go away also.
And we call this process by which the BC link forms, we call it triadic closure.
Because in a sense, what we're seeing here is a triangle closing.
AB and AC were two pieces of the triangle.
And this BC link completes the triangle.
And the principal of triadic closure in social networks
is that if B and C have a friend in common, then
there's an increased chance that a link will form between them.
Now that's a slightly informal statement.
But it's the same about relative tendencies.
Edges form more when there are friends in common.
Triadic closure is one of these empirical phenomena
that gets observed a lot.
It's very, very robust.
And in part, that's because there are several reasons why
triadic closure operates.
Why is the BC edge more likely to form?
Well, for one reason, B and C have an increased opportunity
to meet each other because they have A as this common reference point.
Similarly, A actually, in some context, has an incentive
to bring B and C together because A may want his or her friends to know
each other and may want to introduce them to each other.
And that in the end also closes the triangle.
And a third one is actually that if we know
that B and C are both friends with A, then we know that at some level,
they're kind of similar.
They may live in similar places.
They may have similar interests.
And so even if they never actually realize that they both knew A,
there are all sorts of reasons why that link might
be more likely to form, simply because we know B and C are more similar.
So that's triadic closure.
And that helps explain why in fact social networks
are very rich in triangles.
If you look at a picture of a social network,
you tend to see lots and lots of triangles though mutual friends.
And often, that has formed through some kind of triadic closure.
Now the next step in our understanding of how information gets you
and the different roles people play is to think about parts of the network
where triadic closure has somehow failed to happen.
So let's take a look at this picture of a graph where
we have these two tightly knit groups.
Lots of triangles on the right.
One is A, C, D, and E. And the other one includes this other friend
of A, node B. And node B's in this other group.
If you think about it, A has these four friends in the picture-- B, C, D,
and E. But B is somehow different from C, D, and E.
C, D, and E are this close knit group.
And B is over in this other group.
And that edge between A and B, we'll call a bridge.
It's a bridge.
And what a bridge is is an edge whose deletion
would place the two ends, A and B in different components,
sort of like the last link between them.
So if I were to delete the AB edge, A and B would be in different components.
We call it a bridge.
Now if we think about our intuitions about networks
that we've been building up and our intuitions about big social networks,
if those intuitions have taught us anything,
it's that bridges are probably very, very rare.
It might seem like you and this friend that sort
of very little you have in common, but it's very hard
to believe that if you were to actually erase the friendship,
the world would actually fall into two gigantic different pieces.
It's more likely that there is some other way, some other path between you
and this friend, it's just longer and sort of hard for either of you
to perceive.
So let's draw this larger picture.
Maybe actually that picture that we drew is
embedded in this bigger picture of the social network which
has all these other nodes.
And we now notice, in fact, although A and B
feel like there's this bridge between them, in fact,
there is this other way through F, G, and H-- something that neither of them
may realize this because neither of them knows G, for example.
We're going to call that, in this case, we're
going to say that the AB edge is not a bridge, but a local bridge.
So a local bridge is an edge where the two
endpoints have no neighbors in common.
The two nodes, A and B, can't directly perceive
that there's this other shortcut, but they're
in fact is this other way around.
So an AB edge is a local bridge if A and B have no neighbors in common.
Now let's come back to how information gets to you.
And the point is that if I think about A's friends-- now A's up to 5 friends
here, I guess.
They've got B, C, D, and F. It's still the case
that somehow B is special because B is over in this other group.
So think about this from the point of view
of information coming to A. B knows stuff probably
that's circulating around in B's own group that none of A's other friends
know.
So C, D, and E are these close friends and they want to share a bunch of stuff
with A. And if A's looking for a job, in particular,
C, D, and E are really motivated to help A find a job because they're
close friends and they want A to find a job, be successful, and so forth.
But the problem is they tend to know the same things that A does.
And so if A doesn't know about job leads, they probably don't either.
Whereas B, who's this sort of friend over in this other group,
actually has access to a bunch of information
that A can't directly perceive.
And so if you think about job leads and other kinds of novel information,
it seems likely that it's going to often be filtered in through nodes like B who
have access to this other stuff.
But of course, we need to come back to what actually came out
of Mark Granovetter's interviews about jobs.
People didn't say, oh, I found out about my job via a local bridge.
They said I found out about it from an acquaintance.
And so we need to complete this link.
We need to relate this structural picture we have,
which feels kind of right, this role of local bridges,
to the interpersonal picture, this picture of acquaintances
versus close friends.
And so if we're going to do that, we're going
to need a notion of distinguishing edges into close friends
versus acquaintances, something we haven't done so far.
And then we're going to need to understand
how a triadic closure operates when we're
in this richer world of close friends and acquaintances.
And once we've done that, we'll actually see that we have all the ingredients we
need to actually resolve this puzzle and understand why it's often
you're distant acquaintances who are providing you
with this novel information.
