So far, we talked about networks of friends.
In our networks links suggested positive relations.
Some were stronger and others were weaker, but they were all positive.
But positive people can actually have negative relations, too.
Sometimes, there's agreements or outright conflicts or antagonism.
What we're going to do next is study networks
with both positive and negative links.
What we want to understand is how these kind of networks look like.
We're going to start with very small networks, like a group of three people.
And we want to understand how typical friends and enemy relations work
on very small groups, just three people.
Analogous to how we want to understand three people with friends--
and trying to get closure was one example
of how that relation worked with three people.
And in this case, once we understood the small networks,
we're going to be able to see that it implies a global structure of how
the network can look like.
So let's start with some examples.
So this is little network here on just six nodes.
And I indicated with plus and minus signs and colors
of which relations are positive and which relations are negative.
And this is the kind of typical network that we want to think about.
To give you a context of where this kind of thing commonly arrives-- maybe
one powerful example is coming from World War II, where countries somehow
aligned themselves into alliances.
And Germany was well aligned with Japan and the US was well
aligned with Great Britain, but World War II
can be though of s a tension between these two groups of countries.
So in this case, the graph is not between people, but instead
between countries.
You can also think of this in a context of company relations,
like, for example, the CEO likes one of the VPs more than the other VP,
or maybe he has issues with one of the VPs.
But it turns out that VP has a very positive connection with the board that
causes tensions in the company's life.
So this is another situation where some positive and some negative relations
are present and describe a network structure.
So we want to start with very, very small groups-- just three people.
Generally, we'll assume that we're thinking
about a really small group, such as a company or even
countries in the world, where every pair of countries or every pair of people
in a small company will have some relation.
Some are positive and some are negative.
But they will all know each other.
So here is a group of just three people--
I think a very typical kind of group.
This is persons A, B, and C. And it turns out they're all friends.
And we're going to classify this as a natural, balanced, simple relation.
Its common in the world and just represents a group of friends.
In contrast, if I think about this kind of relations,
where C is friends with both A and B, but A and B
have tension or negative relations to each other, this kind of awkward.
It's certainly unpleasant for C, and maybe even unpleasant or awkward for A
and B also, who while apparently intensely disliking each other,
have a shared friend.
So we're going to classify this kind of relation
as causing good group tensions, or that it's unbalanced.
And what one observes in real-life situations
is that these kind of relations between three people often results themselves.
Either C convinces A and B to actually become positive towards each other
or become reasonably good friends anyhow, or another thing can happen,
and it could be that one of the relations turns negative.
So if you look at this network, there is negative relations of B
both with A and C, but A and C are friends with each other.
If you think about this, this is also much, much more common.
The way I would think about it is an antagonistic relation
between one group against one person B. A and C lined up as friends,
and they together dislike B-- also pretty common.
And let's think of this as a balanced relation, balanced network.
It happens in real life a lot.
And there's no reason this relation can change.
It can go on for a long, long time, keeping this kind of relation.
So we almost had all three possible relations.
There's one more left-- I guess the all negative one.
That is, A, B, and C all instances they dislike each other.
And I'm thinking this one is also unbalanced.
It's not really that it's unpleasant particularly for anyone,
other than disliking people might be unpleasant.
But rather, there is an opportunity here-- an opportunity for two people
to line up with each other.
And if you think about this, I guess maybe
one common example-- so for example, A and C can line up with each other,
and we can go back to the previous version
where A and C are going against B together.
So one common example to think about this kind of tradition
is what happened in World War II, where, remember,
the US and Great Britain was also aligned with USSR.
Actually, with more recent hindsight, this is harder to remember or explain,
but I think you can think of it as they had a shared enemy.
And they aligned themselves to work against the shared enemy.
So so far, we went through the three little examples.
We saw our balanced and unbalanced triangles or relations of three people.
And what we want to think about next is what
are bigger examples of graphs with balanced and unbalanced relations.
So one typical example of a balance graph
is where all relations are positive.
This is just a giant group of friends.
And indeed, every triangle in this graph is balanced.
Another simple example for a really large graph or arbitrarily large graph
where all triangles are balanced would be
a graph of with two polarized groups.
So I'm suggesting a graph here with A, E, F, and C
are a tight group of friends.
And D, G, and B also are two groups of friends.
But these two groups are polarized.
They're are negative on each other.
There are many examples of these kind of scenarios in life.
And just to mention a few from politics, you
can think of the Democrats against the Republicans
or the pro-choice people against the pro-life people.
There are many examples of this sort, even in our everyday life.
What we're going to ask next is what life structures are possible--
what are graphs like when every triangle is balanced?
Does that imply a global structure of the kind we just
saw with two groups or just one group?
Or are there other kinds of structures possible or other
big graphs possible that don't satisfy this structure?
